# Project description
Site listing the Swedish parliment, where you can filter on party, and post a question.

The madeup purpose: the Swedish partliment wants to get closer to the younger population in Sweden, by presenting themselves in a personal manner, and opening up for anyone to ask anything.

# Tech 
JavaScript and React. First time using localStorage to store API result.

# Future features
Content: add About us and Not Found page.

Functionality: add interactivity on the member cards (open e-mail when clicking on member), make it possible to filter on several parties together, add name search on parliment members.

Styling: indicate which page the user is on in the top menu, indicate which party filter the user has clicked on, indicate which party a member belongs.

Behind the scenes: add backend to which the question is posted (MondoDB, Express.js, Mongoose), breakout smaller components.
